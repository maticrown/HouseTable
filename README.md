Welcome to my mini House Evaluation project!

This project is divided into a client and a server app to register and retrive house evaluation data from the database.

prerequisites: cd NodeJsServerApp and run in your terminal:
            axios - npm i axios
            cors - npm install cors
            sequelize - npm i sequelize
